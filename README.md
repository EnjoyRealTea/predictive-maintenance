# predictive-maintenance
### A case study using a random forest classification model to predict machine failures.

**Challenge:** Temperature readings, vibration levels, operational hours, and
more. Your mission? To unravel the mysteries within this data and develop a
machine learning model that can predict when a machine is on the brink of
failure. By doing so, you can help FutureTech transition from reactive repairs
to proactive maintenance, ensuring the gears of Technopolis never stop
turning.

**Objective:** Develop a machine learning model that can predict when a
machine is on the brink of failure.

For this case study, I made use of a predictive maintenance dataset found on Kaggle.
